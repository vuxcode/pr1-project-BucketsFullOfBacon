# Time Report

> Write about what you have done and how long you have worked on each part of the project.

For example: 

- 2023-04-04 20:44 Worked for 5 hour.
  - spent about two hours to get "github to work" (with your help), then spent 3 hours getting to grips with the basics of "charCodeAt" function, as i turned out it wont work with arrays so the "split" function that i added was unnecesary. 
- 2023-04-05 21:00 Worked for 4 hours.
  - lots of experimenting and researching to find the command/ functions that i needed and then getting to grips with them and getting them to work.
