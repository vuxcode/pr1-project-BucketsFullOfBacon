    // Getting the basic function of the decryption to work before intergrateing it to the "main" program
    var inputtedText = "Hello world";
    var asciiText = [];
    console.log (inputtedText);
// the real kicker that took me a while to figure out was that despite what i thougt, i didn't need to split the string into an array because "s.charCodeAt" DO NOT work with arrays, or atleast i couldn't get it to work with one. but the "charToASCII" function automaticaly splits the string into an array as it converts it to ascii.
    function charToASCII() {
        for (var index = 0; index < inputtedText.length; index++) {
            asciiText[index] = inputtedText.charCodeAt(index);
        }
    }
charToASCII(inputtedText)
console.log (asciiText)
